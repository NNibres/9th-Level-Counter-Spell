# Progress Report (March 26, 2018)
## Overview
After getting accustomed to the use of the applications and determining the scope of the different security roles of the application we changed our focus towards testing use cases. Our client from the Commingled Remains and Analytics (CoRA) web application has provided us with a route list containing all of the pages that exist in the environment. Using this along with NIST 800-53 policy control list, we were able to create a spreadsheet of more than 300 use cases that we would want to create automated test scripts for. Since we have completed the use cases for testing the application, we started creating the automated test scripts for the routes excluding the administrative pages.

## Outcomes
What we achieved:
-Created Use Cases for General Authentication Functions
-Created Use Cases for Authorization Scope for Security Roles for Users
-Created Use Cases for Authorization Scope for Organizations
-Created Use Cases for Administrative Functions
-Learning the Environment and Testing Tool
-Started Creating Automated Test Scripts in Laravel Dusk

## Hindrances
Many of the challenges the team encountered had to do with the learning curve that came along  with the test environment setup process. The process hit quite a few bumps due to the fact that we’re all running varying operating systems, and getting the configuration working just right on each unique machine was a time-consuming process. Also, the team is relatively unfamiliar with PHP web application testing, so we’ve had to do quite a bit of research in order to understand how the tests will work. The last challenge the team has face is the setback of refining the scope of the project after the initial focus for our use cases was majorly expanded. Initially, we intended to follow the NIST guidelines to formulate use cases, but now we have expanded the scope to encompass a portion of the route lists provided to us by the client. 

## Ongoing Risks
Our initial risk assessment for the project are still very relevant throughout the entire lifetime of the project. Some of the biggest risks that we will be facing will be more towards getting more accustomed to the programming language that the client has required our team to make the scripts for. The other major risk is team availability as personal lives can greatly affect our progress in the project and may put us behind of where we need to be.
