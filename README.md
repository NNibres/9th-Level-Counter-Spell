# 9th-Level-Counter-Spell
CYBR Capstone Project - CoRA Security Testing
## Executive Summary
### Problem Statement
The University of Nebraska at Omaha ISQA department is currently in the works of developing a new application for the Department of Defense. The PHP-based web application will examine human bones that have been scattered in an underwater area and determine if each part can be grouped up to form a full skeleton. This application is called CoRA (Commingled Remains Analytics). CoRA employs standard user roles and rights grouping mechanisms in order to provide proper authentication and authorization for the application. 

The application needs to meet NIST and DoDI application security standards, so the goal of this project is to use automated methods to perform security testing on CoRA. This involves developing test cases and using various scripts to test the application for security vulnerabilities. We are to note down our findings and report them to our client from the ISQA department so that their team can perform and change requests to the application as needed. The findings need to be documented and reproducible in such a way that future students involved in the CoRA project can be brought up to speed quickly on the security testing procedures for future iterations of the application.
### Problem Merit
This project is important for this team not only for the practical applications but also for families affected by the loss of their loved ones in war. CoRAâ€™s recovery of those remains can be that added measure of closure for people left behind by these fallen warriors. Securing the application ensures that measure of closure can be fulfilled.
### Project Goals
* Set up testing environments
* Developing test cases for the application
* Employing test cases to develop PHP test scripts for automatic security testing of CoRA
* Report findings to client, along with scripts and documentation

## Resources & Technology needed:
1) Github: The first tool that we will use while working in our project is Github. We will use Github to upload our work and the work could be some tests, user cases, scripts, results and many other things. This Github repository can be viewed by the students, instructor, as well as the client later on. Moreover, the whole group is going to work on this tool since all the work has to be uploaded to Github.
 
2) Burp suite: The second tool that we will use is called Burp suite. Burp suite is a java-based penetration-testing tool that is used widely by information security professionals to identify any vulnerability that can be used by attackers to attack a particular system. We are planning to use this tool to do some penetration testing on Cora to identify any vulnerabilities.
 
3) Zap: The third tool that we are going to use is Zap. OWASP ZAP is an open source web application that is used by both beginners to application security as well as professionals in penetration testing; this tool is used for network scanning. We will use this tool for the same purpose as burp suite.
 
4) VM: The fourth tool that we are going to use is a virtual machine. In the VM we going to do all penetration testing, create scripts and test them, so basically we are going to do most of the work if not all of it in VM.   
 
5) Phpstorm:  Another tool we will use is called Phpstorm. This tool provides an editor for PHP, HTML, and java script; it also contains error prevention and automated refactoring for PHP and java script code.  We are already working on this tool and it took a while for us to set it up, but it is now working and we have started working on it.
 
6) Laravel Homestead: This tool is a great tool that contains pre-packaged vagrant box, which provides an environment for developing without requiring to install PHP, a web server, and any other server software tools on local machine, so it saves time, offer, and it is a great tool that contains tools needed for development.

7) Dusk: This tool is used for application testing, it is based on the open source tools ChromeDriver and Facebook Php-webdriver which makes it simple to use without the need to experience the long and intense procedure of setting up selenium.
