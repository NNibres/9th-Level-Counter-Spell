CYBR Capstone Project - CoRA Security Testing
## Executive Summary
### Problem Statement
The University of Nebraska at Omaha ISQA department is currently in the works of developing a new application for the Department of Defense. The PHP-based web application will examine human bones that have been scattered in an underwater area and determine if each part can be grouped up to form a full skeleton. This application is called CoRA (Commingled Remains Analytics). CoRA employs standard user roles and rights grouping mechanisms in order to provide proper authentication and authorization for the application. 

The application needs to meet NIST and DoDI application security standards, so the goal of this project is to use automated methods to perform security testing on CoRA. This involves developing test cases and using various scripts to test the application for security vulnerabilities. We are to note down our findings and report them to our client from the ISQA department so that their team can perform and change requests to the application as needed. The findings need to be documented and reproducible in such a way that future students involved in the CoRA project can be brought up to speed quickly on the security testing procedures for future iterations of the application.
### Problem Merit
This project is important for this team not only for the practical applications but also for families affected by the loss of their loved ones in war. CoRAâ€™s recovery of those remains can be that added measure of closure for people left behind by these fallen warriors. Securing the application ensures that measure of closure can be fulfilled.
### Project Goals
* Set up testing environments
* Developing test cases for the application
* Employing test cases to develop PHP test scripts for automatic security testing of CoRA
* Report findings to client, along with scripts and documentation
